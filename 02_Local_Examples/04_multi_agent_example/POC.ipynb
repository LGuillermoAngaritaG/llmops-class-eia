      "Samuel Langhorne Clemens, better known by his pen name Mark Twain, was a renowned American author and humorist born on November 30, 1835, in Florida, Missouri. He grew up in Hannibal, Missouri, a riverside town that would later serve as the inspiration for the fictional Tom Sawyer's hometown. Clemens developed a fascination with steamboats and the Mississippi River, which played a significant role in shaping his literary career.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before pursuing a career in writing, Clemens worked as a typesetter, a riverboat pilot, and a journalist. He began his writing career as a newspaper reporter, eventually moving to Nevada and working as a correspondent for the Virginia City Territorial Enterprise. This period saw the birth of his pen name, Mark Twain, which was derived from his habit of calling out \"mark twain\" when measuring the depth of the water while piloting his steamboat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twain's most famous works include \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\" (1876) and \"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" (1885). These novels, often considered classics of American literature, dealt with themes of childhood innocence, social commentary, and racial issues. His writing style, characterized by its wit, satire, and humor, has made him one of the most beloved and respected American authors of all time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout his life, Twain was an advocate for social justice, often publicly speaking out against issues such as slavery, racism, and corruption. He was also a fierce critic of emerging technological advancements, particularly the telephone, which he deemed a \"a meddling device.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Twain's personal life was marked by both triumphs and tragedies. He married Olivia Langdon in 1870 and had four children with her. The couple's relationship was seemingly ideal, with Twain describing their marriage as \"a romance.\" However, their joy was short-lived as Olivia's health began to decline, and she passed away in 1904. Twain later married Isabel Lyon, a woman who was 20 years his junior, in 1904.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mark Twain died on April 21, 1910, in Redding, Connecticut, leaving behind a legacy as one of the greatest American writers. His works continue to be widely read and admired today, with \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\" and \"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" topping the list of most enduring American novels. His wit, wisdom, and literary genius have made him an iconic figure in American literature, and his writing continues to inspire generations of writers, scholars, and readers alike.\u001b[00m\n",
