# Databricks Examples

This directory contains example notebooks demonstrating various LLM operations and implementations in Databricks.

## Contents

1. `01_basic_chain.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook showcasing basic LLM chain implementation in Databricks.
2. `02_agent.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook demonstrating LLM agent implementation and usage in Databricks.

## Purpose

These examples serve as practical demonstrations for implementing Language Learning Models (LLMs) in a Databricks environment. The notebooks progress from basic concepts to more advanced implementations, helping users understand how to effectively utilize LLMs within their Databricks workflows.

## Prerequisites

- Access to a Databricks workspace
- Basic understanding of Python and Jupyter notebooks
- Familiarity with LLM concepts

## Usage

To use these examples:
1. Import the notebooks into your Databricks workspace
2. Follow the instructions within each notebook
3. Execute the cells sequentially to understand the implementation

## Note

Make sure to review any requirements or dependencies specified within individual notebooks before running them.
